This film sure was better than that bore, \"Oh, God\". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don\\'t consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one.

I had never heard of Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought \"This is probably the best thing on TV I will ever see in my life.\" 42 years later, that has held true. There is still nothing so amazing, so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here. You can talk about all the super-stars you want to, this is the most superlative of them all!<br /><br />You name it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is truly a story-teller. Her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary. But this special was made in the beginning, and helped to create the legend that she quickly became. In spite of rising so far in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise, revealing more of her talents as she went along. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed in viewing this.'\n","Label:  1\n","Review:  b\"Firstly, I would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense.<br /><br />Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. The actors are highly believable, the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. <br /><br />There is much mystique in this film. Many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him?<br /><br />A fantastic film with a large chill factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch.<br /><br />Look forward to more of these fantastic films!!\"\n","Label:  1\n","Review:  b\"I'm sorry but I didn't like this doc very much.

In order to avoid unexpected truncation of the dataset, the partially cached contents of the dataset  will be discarded. This can happen if you have an input pipeline similar to `dataset.cache().take(k).repeat()`. You should use `dataset.take(k).cache().repeat()` instead.\n"]}],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":62,"source":["vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(\n","    max_tokens=VOCAB_SIZE,\n","    output_mode='int',\n","    output_sequence_length=MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH)\n","\n","# Make a text-only dataset (without labels), then call `TextVectorization.adapt`.\n","train_text = train_ds.map(lambda text, labels: text)\n","vectorize_layer.adapt(train_text)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":63,"source":["def vectorize_text(text, label):\n","  text = tf.expand_dims(text, -1)\n","  return vectorize_layer(text), label"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":64,"source":["train_ds = train_ds.map(vectorize_text)\n","val_ds = val_ds.map(vectorize_text)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":65,"source":["# Configure datasets for performance as before.\n","train_ds = configure_dataset(train_ds)\n","val_ds = configure_dataset(val_ds)"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":66,"source":["model = create_model(vocab_size=VOCAB_SIZE + 1, num_labels=1)\n","model.summary()"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Model: \"sequential_5\"\n","_________________________________________________________________\n"," Layer (type)                Output Shape              Param #   \n","=================================================================\n"," embedding_2 (Embedding)     (None, None, 64)          640064    \n","                                                                 \n"," conv1d_2 (Conv1D)           (None, None, 64)          20544     \n","                                                                 \n"," global_max_pooling1d_2 (Glo  (None, 64)               0         \n"," balMaxPooling1D)                                                \n","                                                                 \n"," dense_3 (Dense)             (None, 1)                 65        \n","                                                                 \n","=================================================================\n","Total params: 660,673\n","Trainable params: 660,673\n","Non-trainable params: 0\n","_________________________________________________________________\n"]}],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":67,"source":["model.compile(\n","    loss=losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n","    optimizer='adam',\n","    metrics=['accuracy'])"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":68,"source":["history = model.fit(train_ds, validation_data=val_ds, epochs=3)"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/3\n","313/313 [==============================] -
